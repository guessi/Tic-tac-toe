# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Tic-tac-toe game implementation. Tic-tac-toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. The game will provide a simple, intuitive interface for players to enjoy the classic game.
