# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for adding game statistics tracking to the Tic-tac-toe game. The feature will track and display the number of wins for each player (X and O) and the number of draws. The statistics will persist across game sessions, allowing players to keep track of their performance over time.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Statistics Tracking

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to track wins, losses, and draws, so that I can see how well I'm performing over multiple games.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a game ends with Player X winning THEN the system SHALL increment Player X's win count.
2. WHEN a game ends with Player O winning THEN the system SHALL increment Player O's win count.
3. WHEN a game ends in a draw THEN the system SHALL increment the draw count.
4. WHEN statistics are updated THEN the system SHALL persist the updated statistics to local storage.
5. WHEN the game is loaded THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display the previously saved statistics.

### Requirement 2: Statistics Display

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see the current game statistics displayed on the screen, so that I can easily track the results without having to remember them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the current statistics (X wins, O wins, draws) in a dedicated statistics section.
2. WHEN a game ends THEN the system SHALL update the displayed statistics immediately.
3. WHEN the statistics are displayed THEN the system SHALL present them in a clear, easy-to-read format.
4. WHEN the statistics are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure they are accessible to screen readers.
5. WHEN the statistics are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure they are visually consistent with the rest of the game interface.

### Requirement 3: Statistics Reset

**User Story:** As a player, I want to be able to reset the game statistics, so that I can start tracking from zero when desired.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the statistics are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a "Reset Statistics" button.
2. WHEN the "Reset Statistics" button is clicked THEN the system SHALL reset all statistics (X wins, O wins, draws) to zero.
3. WHEN statistics are reset THEN the system SHALL update the persistent storage to reflect the reset.
4. WHEN statistics are reset THEN the system SHALL provide visual and auditory feedback that the reset was successful.
5. WHEN the "Reset Statistics" button is focused THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate keyboard accessibility.

### Requirement 4: Responsive Design for Statistics

**User Story:** As a player, I want the statistics display to be responsive and work well on different devices, so that I can track my game performance regardless of the device I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is viewed on a desktop THEN the system SHALL display the statistics section in a way that complements the game board.
2. WHEN the game is viewed on a tablet or mobile device THEN the system SHALL adjust the statistics display to fit the smaller screen size.
3. WHEN the game interface changes between light and dark mode THEN the system SHALL ensure the statistics display adapts appropriately to maintain readability.

### Requirement 5: Accessibility for Statistics

**User Story:** As a player with accessibility needs, I want the statistics feature to be fully accessible, so that I can track game results regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the statistics are updated THEN the system SHALL announce the change to screen readers.
2. WHEN the statistics section is navigated with a keyboard THEN the system SHALL provide clear focus indicators.
3. WHEN the "Reset Statistics" button is used THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA attributes and announcements.
4. WHEN the statistics are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure sufficient color contrast for readability.
